'''PROBLEM STATEMENT : You have a water dispenser that can dispense cold, warm, and hot water. Every second, you can either fill up 2 cups with different types of water, or 1 cup of any type of water.
You are given a 0-indexed integer array amount of length 3 where amount[0], amount[1], and amount[2] denote the number of cold, warm, and hot water cups you need to fill respectively. Return the minimum number of seconds needed to fill up all the cups.

Input: amount = [5,4,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: One way to fill up the cups is:
Second 1: Fill up a cold cup, and a hot cup.
Second 2: Fill up a cold cup, and a warm cup.
Second 3: Fill up a cold cup, and a warm cup.
Second 4: Fill up a warm cup, and a hot cup.
Second 5: Fill up a cold cup, and a hot cup.
Second 6: Fill up a cold cup, and a warm cup.
Second 7: Fill up a hot cup.
 '''

'''SOLUTION : Find greatest two value from array and apply water-filling function'''

amount =[]

amount.insert(0,(int(input('Enter no. of cups for cold water :'))))
amount.insert(1,(int(input('Enter no. of cups for warm water :'))))
amount.insert(2,(int(input('Enter no. of cups for hot water :'))))

print(amount)

total = sum(amount)
#print('sum = '+str(total))

time = 0
while (total > 0):
        amount.sort(reverse=True) # sorting list in decreasing order
        #print(amount)
        num1 = amount[0]
        num2 = amount[1]
    
        if(num1 > 0):
            num1 -= 1

        if(num2 > 0):
            num2 -= 1

        amount[0] = num1
        amount[1] = num2
        
        total=sum(amount)

        time += 1
print('Minimum time to fill all cups is = '+str(time))
